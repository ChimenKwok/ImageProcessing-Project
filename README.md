# ImageProcessing-Project

Important: Since the PyQt 5 and OpenCV have the same name for Qtcore. So, please install the OpenCV by this command in terminal: pip install opencv-contrib-python-headless

Since the GitHub allows file up to 100 MB only, all the lib need to be installed to run the program.
lib needed: PyQt5, numpy, cv2(please intall cv2 by command: pip install opencv-contrib-python-headless)

If you want, all implementation of algorithms in the common.py file can be use directely without interface.


common.py: all the implementation of algorithms discussed above were implement in this file. 

main.py: this file is the code for the program which mainly for the user interface.

UI.py: all the elements of the interface are in this file.



The files with "Sample" as prefix are samples I used to test the program as following.

Sample.jpg

Sample.mp4

Sample_out.jpg
